# CESM-paleo-boundary-conditions
A guideline on building boundary conditions and running a paleoclimate CESM simulation.
The guideline includes helpful resources, instructions for building each model (ocean, coupler, land, runoff, atmosphere), instructions for initial runs and building a water isotope-enabled run, and tips for potential errors and running longer simulations.
The user is respomsible for finding (or creating) an appropriate topography/bathymetry netcdf and vegetation netcdf.
Some scripts may be outdated, though everything works as of August, 2023. If certain scripts are outdated, their newer versions may be found in the same directory as the older script.
